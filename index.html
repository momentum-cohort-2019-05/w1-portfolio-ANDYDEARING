            <h1>Andy Dearing</h1>
            <h3>Full Stack Engineer</h3>
            <p>I am a focused professional. I habitually perform in the very highest tier of my peers due to my work ethic and voracious appetite for learning.</p>
            <p>This year, I left a successful career in sales to persue my dream of software development. Once technology changed from an interest to a career, I've put in the work to learn web development with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, version control with Git and GitHub, and web application development with Python and Django. Since graduating from Momentum Learning this summer, I've added Ruby, React, and AWS, with more to come.</p>
